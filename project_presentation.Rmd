# Motivation


# Data Introduction

### Data Introduction
- Data comes from the World Bank on the United States from 1960 to 2018
- Includes CO2 emissions, economic data (GDP, GDI, primary income), and energy consumption
- Many highly correlated variables


### Data Introduction 

```{r, facet, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
```


### Data Introduction

```{r, correlation plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
